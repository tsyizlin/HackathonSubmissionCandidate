Continue working on any tasks in project_plan.md that are not yet completed. Do not ask me any questions, use your best judgement. When all tasks are completed, do not make any more changes, just tell me you're done by saying "ALL DONE!". DEDICATED_STORE_PEER address should never be changed. Always follow established patterns in waku-app-config.ts because this code is very brittle. Make sure the ordering of declarations is correct in your changes. Remember that the waku API does not support different decoder per content topic. Do not modify project_plan.md.  Make sure when using waku messaging that you carefully think through the timing of when to check for historical messages. Make sure to define all imports. Don't modify the "read-only" named files, but use them as working examples for how to use waku properly, particularly when observing how to activate listening on a contentTopic when needed. Do not modify useWaku.ts or waku-client.ts.
