let's begin working through the project_plan.md. Refactor the existing confession board app according to the project plan - we are trying to work towards the goal described in project_goal.md. In each turn, complete as many coding tasks as possible from the project_plan.md - you can output a lot of changes per turn. Do not ask me any questions, use your best judgement. DEDICATED_STORE_PEER address should never be changed. Always follow established patterns in waku-app-config.ts because this code is very brittle. Make sure the ordering of declarations is correct in your changes. Remember that the waku API does not support different decoder per content topic. Do not modify project_plan.md. Make sure when using waku messaging that you carefully think through the timing of when to check for historical messages. Make sure to define all imports. Don't modify the "read-only" named files, but use them as working examples for how to use waku properly, particularly when observing how to activate listening on a contentTopic when needed. Place all css changes in globals.css.
